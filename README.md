Reporting to the Head of Operations, I conducted a comprehensive performance audit of Olist, a leading Brazilian e-commerce integrator. This audit evaluates the company’s transition from a startup pilot to an enterprise-level marketplace, processing over **$3M in normalized Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)** across 100,000+ orders. 

By accounting for currency volatility and logistical bottlenecks, this analysis identifies the "real-value" trajectory of the platform and provides a strategic roadmap for sustainable scaling.
